	   Faster Algorithms via Approximation Theory illustrates how
      classical and modern techniques from approximation theory play a
      crucial role in obtaining results that are relevant to the
      emerging theory of fast algorithms. The key lies in the fact
      that such results imply faster ways to approximate primitives
      such as \(A^s v, A^{-1}v, \exp(-A)v\), eigenvalues and
      eigenvectors, which are fundamental to many spectral
      algorithms. </br>

	    The first half of the book is devoted to the ideas and results from
	    approximation theory that are central, elegant, and may
	    have wider applicability in theoretical computer
	    science. These include not only techniques relating to
	    polynomial approximations but also those relating to
	    approximations by rational functions and beyond. The
	    remaining half illustrates a variety of ways that these
	    results can be used to design fast algorithms. </br>

	    Faster Algorithms via Approximation Theory is
	    self-contained and should be of interest to researchers
	    and students in theoretical computer science, numerical
	    linear algebra, and related areas.

	Given k collections of 2SAT clauses on the same set of

	constant factor <it>Pareto</it> approximation algorithm for k
	simultaneous Max-F-CSP instances. Our methods are quite general, and

	simultaneous Max-w-SAT (for \(k
	<\tilde{O}(\log^{\frac{1}{3}} n)\)).  In contrast, for \(k =
	\omega(\log n)\), no nonzero approximation factor for k
	simultaneous Max-F-CSP instances can be achieved in polynomial time
	(assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis).<br/>

	These problems are a natural meeting point for the theory of constraint

	  We study the problem of computing the minimum vertex cover
	  on k-uniform k-partite hypergraphs when the
	  k-partition is given. On bipartite graphs (k=2), the
	  minimum vertex cover can be computed in polynomial time. For
	  k\(\ge 3,\) this problem is known to be NP-hard. For general
	  k, the problem was studied by Lovász, who gave a
	  \(\frac{k}{2}\)-approximation based on the standard LP
	  relaxation. Subsequent work by Aharoni, Holzman, and
	  Krivelevich showed a tight integrality gap of \(\frac{k}{2}
	  - o(1))\) for the LP relaxation. We further investigate the
	  inapproximability of minimum vertex cover on k-uniform
	  k-partite hypergraphs and present the following results
	  (here \(\varepsilon  > 0\) is an arbitrarily small constant):
	  NP-hardness of obtaining an approximation factor of
	  \((\frac{k}{4} - \varepsilon)\) for even k and \((\frac{k}{4}
	  - \frac{1}{4k} - \varepsilon)\) for odd k, NP-hardness of
	  obtaining a nearly optimal approximation factor of
	  \((\frac{k}{2}-1+\frac{1}{2k}-\varepsilon)\), and an optimal
	  unique games-hardness for approximation within factor
	  \((\frac{k}{2} - \varepsilon)\), showing the optimality of
	  Lovász's algorithm if one assumes the Unique Games
	  conjecture. The first hardness result is based on a
	  reduction from minimum vertex cover in r-uniform
	  hypergraphs, for which NP-hardness of approximating within
	  \(r - 1 -\varepsilon\) was shown by Dinur, Guruswami, Khot,
	  and Regev. We include it for its simplicity, despite it
	  being subsumed by the second hardness result. The unique
	  games-hardness result is obtained by applying the results of
	  Kumar, Manokaran, Tulsiani, and Vishnoi, with a slight
	  modification, to the LP integrality gap due to Aharoni,
	  Holzman, and Krivelevich. The modification ensures that the
	  reduction preserves the desired structural properties of the
	  hypergraph. The reduction for the nearly optimal NP-hardness
	  result relies on the multilayered PCP of Dinur, Guruswami,
	  Khot, and Regev and uses a gadget based on biased long codes
	  adapted from the LP integrality gap of Aharoni, Holzman, and
	  Krivelevich. Our reduction requires the analysis of several
	  long codes with different biases, for which we prove
	  structural properties of the so-called cross-intersecting
	  collections of set families, variants of which have been
	  studied in extremal set theory.  </p>

 This work studies the inapproximability of Minimum Vertex Cover on
	  uniform hypergraphs from a specific structural perspective. Our
	  study is motivated by applications to two well known scheduling
	  problems: <i>Concurrent Open Shop</i> and the <i>Assembly Line</i>
	  problem. For both these problems, Bansal and Khot [BK10]
	  obtained tight \((2-\epsilon)\)-factor inapproximability, assuming the
	  Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). In this work, we prove optimal
	  \((2-\epsilon)\)-factor NP-hardness of approximation for both these
	  problems <i>unconditionally</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, without assuming UGC.

	  Our results for the scheduling problems follow from a structural
	  hardness for Minimum Vertex Cover on hypergraphs -- an unconditional
	  but weaker analog of a similar result of Bansal and
	  Khot [BK10] which however, is based on UGC.</p>

 We give a novel spectral approximation algorithm for the

	  constant balance b \(\in (0,\frac{1}{2}],\) and a parameter \(\gamma,\)
	  either finds an \(\Omega(b)\)-balanced cut of conductance
	  \(O(\sqrt{\gamma})\) in G, or outputs a certificate that all
	  b-balanced cuts in G have conductance at least \(\gamma,\)
	  and runs in time \(\tilde{O}(m).\) This settles the question
	  of designing asymptotically optimal spectral algorithms for
	  balanced separator.  Our algorithm relies on a variant of
	  the heat kernel random walk and requires, as a subroutine,
	  an algorithm to compute exp(-L)v where L is the
	  Laplacian of a graph related to G and v is a
	  vector. Algorithms for computing the
	  matrix-exponential-vector product efficiently comprise our
	  next set of results. Our main result here is a new algorithm
	  which computes a good approximation to exp(-A)v for a
	  class of symmetric positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices A
	  and a given vector v, in time roughly \(\tilde{O}(m_A),\)
	  where \(m_A\) is the number of non-zero entries of A. This
	  uses, in a non-trivial way, the breakthrough result of
	  Spielman and Teng on inverting symmetric and
	  diagonally-dominant matrices in \(\tilde{O}(m_A)\) time.
	  Finally, we prove that \(e^{-x}\) can be uniformly
	  approximated up to a small additive error, in a non-negative
	  interval [a,b] with a polynomial of degree roughly
	  \(\sqrt{b-a}.\) While this result is of independent interest
	  in approximation theory, we show that, via the Lanczos
	  method from numerical analysis, it yields a simple algorithm
	  to compute exp(-A)v for symmetric PSD matrices that runs
	  in time roughly \(O(t_A\cdot \sqrt{\|A\|}),\) where \(t_A\)
	  is time required for the computation of the vector Aw for
	  given vector w. As an application, we obtain a simple and
	  practical algorithm, with output conductance
	  \(O(\sqrt{\gamma}),\) for balanced separator that runs in time
	  \(\tilde{O}(\frac{m}{\sqrt{\gamma}}).\) This latter algorithm
	  matches the running time, but improves on the approximation
	  guarantee of the Evolving-Sets-based algorithm by Andersen
	  and Peres for balanced separator.</p>

 Suppose we are given an oracle that claims to approximate
	  the permanent for most matrices X, where X is chosen from the
	  <i>Gaussian ensemble</i> the matrix entries are i.i.d.~univariate
	  complex Gaussians).  Can we test that the oracle satisfies this claim?
	  This paper gives a polynomial-time algorithm for the task.
	  
	  The oracle-testing problem is of interest because a recent paper of
	  Aaronson  and Arkhipov  showed that  if there  is  a polynomial-time
	  algorithm  for   simulating  boson-boson  interactions   in  quantum
	  mechanics, then  an approximation oracle  for the permanent  (of the
	  type  described   above)  exists  in BPP^NP.  Since  computing
	  the permanent of  even 0/1 matrices is  #P-complete, this seems
	  to demonstrate  more computational  power in quantum  mechanics than
	  Shor's factoring algorithm does. However, unlike factoring, which is
	  in NP, it was unclear previously how to test  the   correctness
	  of  an  approximation   oracle  for  the   permanent, and this is
	  the contribution of the paper. 

	  The technical difficulty overcome here is that univariate polynomial
	  self-correction, which  underlies similar oracle-testing algorithms
	  for permanent over<i> finite fields</i> ---and whose discovery led to
	  a  revolution in complexity  theory---does not  seem to  generalize to
	  complex (or even, real) numbers.   We believe that
	  this  tester will  motivate further  progress on  understanding the
	  permanent of Gaussian matrices.</p>

	  A community in a social network is usually understood to
	  be a group of nodes more densely connected with each other than with
	  the rest of the network. This is an important concept in most domains
	  where networks arise: social, technological, biological, etc. For many
	  years algorithms for ﬁnding communities implicitly assumed communities
	  are nonoverlapping (leading to use of clustering-based approaches) but
	  there is increasing interest in ﬁnding overlapping communities. A
	  barrier to ﬁnding communities is that the solution concept is often
	  deﬁned in terms of an NP-complete problem such as Clique or
	  Hierarchical Clustering.<br/>
	  This paper seeks to initiate a rigorous
	  approach to the problem of ﬁnding overlapping communities, where
	  “rigorous” means that we clearly state the following: (a) the object
	  sought by our algorithm (b) the assumptions about the underlying
	  network (c) the (worst-case) running time.<br/>
	  Our assumptions about the
	  network lie between worst-case and average-case. An average-case
	  analysis would require a precise probabilistic model of the network,
	  on which there is currently no consensus. However, some plausible
	  assumptions about network parameters can be gleaned from a long body
	  of work in the sociology community spanning ﬁve decades focusing on
	  the study of individual communities and ego-centric networks (in graph
	  theoretic terms, this is the subgraph induced on a node’s
	  neighborhood). Thus our assumptions are somewhat “local” in
	  nature. Nevertheless they suﬃce to permit a rigorous analysis of
	  running time of algorithms that recover global structure. <br/>
	  Our
	  algorithms use random sampling similar to that in property testing and
	  algorithms for dense graphs. We note however that our networks are not
	  necessarily dense graphs, not even in local neighborhoods.  Our
	  algorithms explore a local-global relationship between ego-centric and
	  socio-centric networks that we hope will provide a fruitful
	framework for future work both in computer science and sociology. </p>

	  We study the problem of computing the minimum vertex cover on
	  \(k\)-uniform \(k\)-partite hypergraphs when the \(k\)-partition is given.
	  On bipartite graphs \((k=2)\), the minimum vertex cover can be
	  computed in polynomial time.  For general \(k\), the problem was
	  studied by Lov&aacutesz, who gave a
	  \(\frac{k}{2}\)-approximation based on the standard LP
	  relaxation. Subsequent work by Aharoni, Holzman and
	  Krivelevich showed a tight integrality gap of
	  \(\frac{k}{2} - o(1)\) for the LP relaxation. 
	  While this problem was
	  known to be NP-hard for \(k\geq 3\), the first non-trivial NP-hardness
	  of approximation factor of \(\frac{k}{4}-\epsilon\) was shown in a recent
	  work by Guruswami and Saket. They also showed that
	  assuming Khot's Unique Games Conjecture yields a \(\frac{k}{2}-\epsilon\)
	  inapproximability for this problem, implying the optimality of
	  Lov&aacutesz's result.</p>
	  <p>
	  In this work, we 
	  show that this problem is NP-hard to approximate within 
	  \(\frac{k}{2}-1+\frac{1}{2k}-\epsilon\). This hardness factor 
	  is off from the optimal
	  by an additive constant of at most 1 for \(k\geq
	  4\). Our reduction relies on the <it>Multi-Layered PCP</it> of
	  Dinur et al. and uses a gadget -- based on
	  biased Long Codes -- adapted from the LP integrality gap of Aharoni et
	  al. 
	  The nature of our reduction
	  requires the analysis of several Long Codes with different biases, for
	  which we prove structural properties of the so called
	  cross-intersecting collections of set families -- 
	  variants of which have

	    For several basic optimization problems, it is NP-hard to
	    find an exact solution. As a result, understanding the
	    best possible trade-off between the running time of an
	    algorithm and its approximation guarantee, is a
	    fundamental question in theoretical computer science, and
	    the central goal of the theory of approximation.</br>

	    There are two aspects to the theory of approximation : (1) efficient approximation algorithms that establish trade-offs between approximation guarantee and running time, and (2) inapproximability results that give evidence against them. In this thesis, we contribute to both facets of the theory of approximation.</p>

<p>In the first part of this thesis, we present the first near-linear-time algorithm for Balanced Separator - given a graph, partition its vertices into two roughly equal parts without cutting too many edges - that achieves the best approximation guarantee possible for algorithms in its class.  This is a classic graph partitioning problem and has deep connections to several areas of both theory and practice, such as metric embeddings, Markov chains, clustering, etc.</p>

<p>As an important subroutine for our algorithm for Balanced Separator, we provide a near-linear-time algorithm to simulate the heat-kernel random walk on a graph, equivalent to computing \(\exp(-L)v\), where \(L\) is the Laplacian of the graph, and \(v\) is a vector. This algorithm combines techniques from approximation theory and numerical linear algebra to reduce the problem of approximating the matrix exponential to solving a small number of Laplacian systems. We also give a reduction in the reverse direction, from matrix inversion to matrix exponentiation, hence justifying the use of Laplacian system solvers.</p>

<p>In the second part of this thesis, we prove inapproximability results for several basic optimization problems. We address some classic scheduling problems, <it>viz.</it> Concurrent Open Shop and the Assembly Line problem, and variants of the Hypergraph Vertex Cover problem. For all these problems, optimal inapproximability results were previously known under the Unique Games Conjecture. We are able to prove near-optimal inapproximability results for these problems without using the conjecture.
